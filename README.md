Titanium Appcelerator Blackberry 10 Example App - Requires Titanium SDK 3.2.0 GA or higher

This is a clone of the Master/Detail Template within Titanium Studio built using the undocumented Blackberry NavGroup support included in Ti SDK 3.2. I have also included a simple example of howto use the BB10 Application Menu (https://developer.blackberry.com/cascades/reference/bb__Application.html#function-swipedown), as well as the ActionItems (http://developer.blackberry.com/native/documentation/cascades/ui/navigation/menus.html)
